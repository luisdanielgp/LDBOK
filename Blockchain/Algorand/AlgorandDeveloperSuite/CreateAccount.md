# Script for creating and funding a new Algorand account on the private network

Right now the account gets created but funding it is challenging since I need a previously funded account to transfer algos to the new account.

I have accounts with funds that where created on network initialization, but **I haven't figured out how to obtain their private keys so I can sign transactions.**

## Command

`$ algods createaccount`
